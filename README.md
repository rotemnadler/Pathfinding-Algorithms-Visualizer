# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer

The following project visualizes the solving process of pathfinding algorithms.

Operating instructions:

Mouse left-clicks:
1. Chooses the starting point (orange)
2. Chooses the end point (turquoise)
3. Chooses barriers (gray)

Mouse right-clicks:
Resets any chosen block

Running the algorithms:
'a' key - running A*
'b' key - running BFS
'd' key - running Dijkstra 
'n' key - resetting the grid
